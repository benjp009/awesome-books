# Awesome books

We are creating a book library with Charles & Patricia as part of Microverse project (week 6)

## Description

"Awesome books" is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list.
By building this application, you will learn how to manage data using JavaScript. Thanks to that your website will be more interactive.
You will also use a medium-fidelity wireframe to build the UI.


### How to build the "Awesome books" website

We will start by building the core functionalities and ignoring how your website looks. At the very beginning our website will look similar to the UI below. Note that it is plain HTML with no styling, but it will allow you to add and remove books from the list!

  <img src="https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/books/images/awesome_books_basic_ui.png" alt="Basic UI" width="300px" />
</p>

Once we have the code working, we will style the core elements: the books list and the form for adding a new book. We will need to adhere to the layout presented in the wireframe, but we will choose your application's styling. So your initial ugly HTML will turn into something similar to this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/books/images/awesome_books_core_elements.png" alt="Core elements" width="400px"  />
</p>

In the last step, We will build a complete website with working navigation. When a user clicks on a link in the navigation bar, the content in the main section of the website changes (URL stays the same, though.) Again styling is your choice, but it is essential to adhere to the layout presented in the wireframe. Your end result should look similar to this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/books/images/awesome_books_full_website.png" alt="Full website" />
</p>

### Projects list

We will be building your "Awesome books" website for the whole week. Here is the list of projects that will guide you through the steps described above. You will find details about each of the project requirements in the upcoming program activities. In all of the projects, you will be working collaboratively by using pair-programming.

- Day 1: Manage books collection (plain JS with objects).
- Day 2: Manage books collection (plain JS with classes).
- Day 3: Style core elements of the page.
- Day 4: Create a complete website with navigation.
